is AvengerDao?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"AvengerDAO Intro","description":"AvengerDAO is a community driven initiative that protects users from possible exploits, scams and malicious actors on BNB Chain. The founding members of AvengerDAO started this because BNB Chain is the largest public chain today, and the larger the community, the greater the responsibility. Our goal is to protect users from financial losses and malicious contracts. Deter malicious actors and notify BNB Chain\u2019s users. We aim to enhance further adoption by setting an industry standard for safe practices and raise awareness on safety and security in the ecosystem.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"knowledge-base/other-resources":{"id":"knowledge-base/other-resources","title":"Other Resources","description":"* AvengerDao Github","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/consumer-api/authorization":{"id":"meter/consumer-api/authorization","title":"Authorization","description":"When the client calls server\u2019s restful interface, client need to set the following headers to pass the server\u2019s authorization\uff1a","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/consumer-api/changelog":{"id":"meter/consumer-api/changelog","title":"Consumer Change Log","description":"04/25/2023","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/consumer-api/endpoints":{"id":"meter/consumer-api/endpoints","title":"Endpoints","description":"Address security","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/consumer-api/risk-band-rating":{"id":"meter/consumer-api/risk-band-rating","title":"Risk Band Rating Description","description":"We have created band ratings to provide a reference risk level for contracts on the BNB Chain. The band ratings range from Very High Risk to Very Low Risk. In determining the band rating, we have taken into account a variety of factors including, not limited to, whether the contract contains known vulnerabilities or malicious code, implements industry recommendations, and permissions and code audit considerations. Interacting with contracts with lower band ratings may have a higher risk of loss of funds. Users are recommended to always DYOR before interacting with any contract.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/intro":{"id":"meter/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"When receiving an airdrop for a certain token, or interacting with the contracts that they want to invest in, users may want to verify a token\u2019s authenticity, check the security of a contract to be interacted with or get relevant information such as potential risks of a specific address to perform due diligence. This smart contract risk query API is developed to mainly serve these needs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/provider-api/api_contract":{"id":"meter/provider-api/api_contract","title":"API Contract","description":"Request to the Providers","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/provider-api/changelog":{"id":"meter/provider-api/changelog","title":"Changelog","description":"03/13/2023","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/provider-api/endpoints":{"id":"meter/provider-api/endpoints","title":"Endpoints","description":"There will be two types of endpoints, one will be for malicious BNB addresses, such as accounts or contracts, and a second endpoint will be for possible malicious domain names.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"meter/provider-api/integration-guide":{"id":"meter/provider-api/integration-guide","title":"Integration Guide","description":"Welcome to the AvengerDAO Meter integration guide for security providers.
